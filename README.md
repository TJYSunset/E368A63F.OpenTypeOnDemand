## OpenTypeOnDemand

Some sort of text layout engine for MonoGame (DirectX), using FreeType.

Draws text and returns list of textures.

**Work in progress. Do not use this in production and no animal gets harmed.**

### Usage

```csharp
foreach (var glyph in OpenTypeOnDemand.Render(...))
{
    SpriteBatch.Draw(glyph.texture, glyph.position, glyph.color);
}
```

Glyph textures are automatically cached in RAM(?) so calling this on every `Draw()` cycle would be hopefully not too painful. But keep in mind the idea of caching everything may cause serious issues, especially when dealing with a large variety of characters and/or styles.

### Why not use SpriteFont?

Try build a SpriteFont for any single variant of Noto Sans CJK / Source Han Sans within an hour.

### Why not use BMFont (powered by MonoGame.Extended)?

This builds, but not like it has font fallback and stuff.
